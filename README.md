# South West Equestrian Website Project
The goal of this website is to provide an online presence for a small riding school in Donegal giving it a more of a professional image.  The website will allow for an increase in bookings through increased online exposure. The use of an online contact form will speed up enquiries. 
The website will make the business running procedures more efficient as there will be less of a need for someone to man the phone and queries can be submitted at all times via email and social media.
The website will host some key information on the services provided by the stables and encourage potential customers to get in touch.
With the use of this website interested parties willl have some of the most common questions answered such as "What days are beginner classes offered?" and any other questions can be submitted at any time that suits the users rather than being limited to office hours as is the case without this website.
## UX 
### The Strategy Plane 
The aim of this website is to achieve greater exposure and free up resources taken up by taking all bookings via phone.
This will ensure easier and more convenient correspondence between new and existing members of the school when making bookings. 
The audience for this website is likely to mainly be mothers of children and teenagers who are looking to take up horse-riding as well as existing members of the school who enjoy the convenience of booking their lessons through the contact form. 
With this in mind I have designed an image heavy website as it's expected that horse lovers will engage more with the content if they can see pictures of the horses they will be riding.
I have chosen a yellow color scheme as it is a happy, natural, curious color and made use of whitespace for a clean appearance.
I chose to keep text and jargon to a minimum  and stick to key information points as not to overwhelm the user.
A good user experience is when the user uses the contact form to make a booking or enquire about our services. 
Here is a grid of opportunities that this website will create and their importance/feasibility.
The most important opportunity that this website will create is an online presence and increased bookings.

### The Scope Plane
The two main features we want to include in our design is information on the services provided by the school, and a contact form where interested parties can submit queries and book lessons.
### The Structure Plane
The website will consist of three pages, a home page, classes page and contact page.
The home page will host a brief description of the services offered by the riding school. There will be lots of horse images to make the website look inviting for horse lovers.
There will be a 'classes' page which will give further information on the lessons and events including days on which the classes happen.
The third page is the contact page whose main feature is the contact form where customers can request to book a class or submit a query.

### The Surface Plane 
This will be an image heavy website to appeal to customers. The color scheme of the website will white and yellow. I will make use of whitespace and use a bright yellow color for icons and buttons to draw attention to them. 
I will use the Open Sans font as it is has excellent legibility characteristics and was optimised for web and mobile interfaces. There wont be an overwhelming amount of text as we want to encourage interested parties to get in touch via the contact form.
## Features
### Existing Features
This will be user friendly responsive website with clean formatting and clear navigation across all screen sizes. I uses the hamburger menu as I took a mobile first approach to the design and it also looks neat on desktop too. The navbar will direct the user to the "home" page, "classes" page and "contact" page. The home page focuses on intoducing the user to the services available at the riding stables. The "classes" and "contact" pages focus on encouraging the user to get in touch through the use of buttons redirecting them to the contact form.
The classes section allows the user to see which days certain lessons are available which can be used as a reference when making bookings through the direct link to the contact form below class details.
The contact form enables the user to submit booking requests or queries by filling out the form and providing an email address.
### Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to include a member profile section with an online booking and payment system for existing members.
Members can then opt to create a log of their previous bookings and experience which will enable them to make suitable lesson bookings for their riding level.

The website has also been tested on small medium and large screens via Chrome Developer tools. I also tested the website on phone and ipad and followed the above tests to ensure all features are in working order.
I conducted the above tests on Safari to verify that it works correctly.
I ran the the CSS stylesheet through the CSS validator.
