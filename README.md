South West Equestrian Website Project

The goal of this website is to provide an online presence for a small riding school in Donegal and increase bookings and efficiency through the use of an online contact form. 
The website will host some information on the services provided by the stables and encourage potential customers to get in touch via the contact form or connect through social media channels rather than through telephone.
We will take a mobile-first approach to the website in the hopes of maximmising 


UX
The Strategy Plane 
The aim of this website is to achieve greater exposure and free up resources taken up by taking all bookings via phone.
This will ensure easier and more convenient correspondence between new and exisitng members of the school when making bookings. 


The Scope Plane
The two main features we want to include in our desigs is information on the services provided by the school and a contact form where interested parties can submit queries and book lessons.

The Structure Plane

The Skeletal Plane
The website will consist of three pages, a home page, classes page and contact page.
The home page will host a brief description of the services offered by the riding school. There will be lots of horse images to make the website looking inviting for horse lovers.
There will be a classes page which will give further information on the lessons and events including days on which the classes are provided.
The third page is the contact page whose main feature is the contact form.

The Surface Plane 

This website is for new and existing members of the South West Equestrian riding school. It has been designed to provide an online presence for the school and provide a more convenient way for clients to get in contact 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
The classes section allows the user to see which days certain lessons are avilable which can be used as a reference when making bookings through the direct link to the contact form below class details.
The contact form enables the user to submit booking requests or queries by filling out the form and providing an email address.

Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to include a member profile section with an online booking and payment system for existing members.
Members can then opt to create a log of their previous bookings and experience which will enable them to make suitable lesson bookings for their riding level.

Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Testing
I tested the following features to make sure they worked as desired:
1.Navbar:
  i. Go to “Home” page
  ii. Try to access the “Classes” and “Contact” page from the navbar tab.
  iii. Try to access each page again through the navbar tab on the “Classes” and “Contact” page.

2. South West Equestrian:
i. Click on South West Equestrian in the navbar and verify that it redirects to the homepage.

3. Social media links:
  i. From the “Home”, “Classes” and “Contact” pages check the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter icons open the sites in a new tabs when clicked on.
  ii. From the “Home”, “Classes” and “Contact” pages check mail icon opens the “Contact” page in a new tab.

4. Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.


Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
