# South West Equestrian Website Project
The goal of this website is to provide an online presence for a small riding school in Donegal giving it a more of a professional image.  The website will allow for an increase in bookings through increased online exposure. The use of an online contact form will speed up enquiries. 
The website will make the business running procedures more efficient as there will be less of a need for someone to man the phone and queries can be submitted at all times via email and social media.
The website will host some key information on the services provided by the stables and encourage potential customers to get in touch.
## UX 
### The Strategy Plane 
The aim of this website is to achieve greater exposure and free up resources taken up by taking all bookings via phone.
This will ensure easier and more convenient correspondence between new and existing members of the school when making bookings. 
The audience for this website is likely to mainly be mothers of children and teenagers who are looking to take up horse-riding as well as existing members of the school who enjoy the convenience of booking their lessons through the contact form. 
With this in mind I have designed an image heavy website as it's expected that horse lovers will engage more with the content if they can see pictures of the horses they will be riding.
I have chosen a yellow color scheme as it is a happy, natural, curious color and made use of whitespace for a clean appearance.
I chose to keep text and jargon to a minimum  and stick to key information points as not to overwhelm the user.
### The Scope Plane
The two main features we want to include in our design is information on the services provided by the school, and a contact form where interested parties can submit queries and book lessons.
### The Structure Plane
The website will consist of three pages, a home page, classes page and contact page.
The home page will host a brief description of the services offered by the riding school. There will be lots of horse images to make the website look inviting for horse lovers.
There will be a 'classes' page which will give further information on the lessons and events including days on which the classes happen.
The third page is the contact page whose main feature is the contact form where customers can request to book a class or submit a query.

### The Surface Plane 
This website is for new and existing members of the South West Equestrian riding school. It has been designed to provide an online presence for the school and provide a more convenient way for clients to get in contact 
### Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
### Existing Features
The classes section allows the user to see which days certain lessons are available which can be used as a reference when making bookings through the direct link to the contact form below class details.
The contact form enables the user to submit booking requests or queries by filling out the form and providing an email address.
### Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to include a member profile section with an online booking and payment system for existing members.
Members can then opt to create a log of their previous bookings and experience which will enable them to make suitable lesson bookings for their riding level.
### Technologies Used
The technologies used in this project are
- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Bootstrap 
- Github 
- Gitpod 
- Chrome Developer Tools 
- JQuery
### Testing
I tested the following features to make sure they worked as desired:
- Navbar:
  1. Go to “Home” page
  2. Try to access the “Classes” and “Contact” page from the navbar tab.
  3. Try to access each page again through the navbar tab on the “Classes” and “Contact” page.
- South West Equestrian:
  1. Click on South West Equestrian in the navbar and verify that it redirects to the homepage.
- Social media links:
  1. From the “Home”, “Classes” and “Contact” pages check the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter icons open the sites in a new tabs when clicked on.
  2. From the “Home”, “Classes” and “Contact” pages check mail icon opens the “Contact” page in a new tab.
- Contact form:
  1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
  2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
  3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
  4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that page refreshes afterwards.
The website has also been tested on small medium and large screens via Chrome Developer tools. I also tested the website on phone and ipad and followed the above tests to ensure all features are in working order.
### Deployment
The website was coded in Gitpod. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: https://evanneb.github.io/south-west-equestrian/
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
